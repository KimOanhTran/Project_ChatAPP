7 Testing Principles( nguyenli)
-Testing shows presence(hiện diện) of defects

-Exhaustive testing is impossible(Thử nghiệm toàn diện là không thể)
+Testing everything is not feasible except for trivial cases, instead of exhaustive testing, we use risks and priorites(ưu tiên) to focus testing efforts(nỗ lực)
?How to determine risk:
	+what to test first
	+what to test most
	+how thoroughly to test each item
	+what not to test(this time)
	+allocate the time available for testing by prioritizing testing

	
-Early testing
+testing activities should start as early as possible in the software or system development lifi cycle and should be focused on defined objectives
+finds defects early on when they are cheap to find and fix


-Defect clustering(phân cụm)
+A small number of modules contain most of the defect discovered during pre-release testing or show the most operational failure



-Pesticide paradox(Nghịch lý thuốc trừ sâu)
+the test cases need to be regularly reviewed and revised, and new and different tests need to be written


-Testing is context dependent(phụ thuộc vào ngữ cảnh)
+testing is done differently in different contexts. 


-Absence-of-errors fallacy(Ngụy biện không có lỗi)
+finding and fixing defects does not help if the system built is unusable and does not fulfill the user's needs and expectations
